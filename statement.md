# Statement File: Health Myth Buster App

## Problem Statement

Misinformation about health is rampant, with many people believing or spreading unverified myths related to wellness, diseases, and prevention. This can lead to harmful practices, unnecessary fear, or neglect of important health measures. There is a need for a simple, trustworthy, and interactive tool that helps users quickly check the validity of common health-related claims and encourages reliance on evidence-based knowledge[web:12].

## Scope of the Project

- The application will debunk a limited set of widely circulated health myths and confirm selected scientific facts.
- It provides instant verdicts (True, False, Uncertain) based on a preloaded knowledge base.
- The focus is on claims that are relevant to general public health (e.g., vaccines, disease prevention, health practices).
- The user interface is terminal-based and highly accessible, requiring no prior technical knowledge to use.
- The project may be expanded to include new myths, facts, and more advanced validation in future iterations.

## Target Users

- General public seeking clarification about health claims.
- Students learning about public health and scientific literacy.
- Educators or community leaders who want an easy tool to demonstrate evidence-based health practices.
- Anyone interested in quick, trustworthy myth-busting without needing to search the wider internet.
